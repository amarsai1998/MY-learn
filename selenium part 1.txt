Selenium :- 1) It is the tool which we have to test web applications.
2)A fuctional and regression testing is called as autumation testing.
3)A selenium is set of components /tools  
4)Selenium is suite which caontains componenets/tools.

Selenium suite
--------------
1)IDE
2)RC
3)WEB DRIVER 
4)GRID

Selenium:- 1)Is used for for web based applications and it will not destop application.(autoIT,sikull)
2)For selenium doesnt have support.(forums avaiable) 
3)Reporting facility.(testng,extens)
4)images we cant verify. (certain level)

For every disadvantage we can use 3rd party tools for selenum.

Selenium componets:-
------------------ 
IDE--> plug in for firefox browser,record and playback tool.
RC-->RC server will intreact with browser and excute automation test case(in direct process).
WEB DRIVER-->Is like api it will connect through browser directly .(Excute autmation test case directly).
GRID--> It can excute the test cases remotely.

Topics:-
-----
Java
web driver 
AutoIT
TestNG framework


Functional testing -Behavour of application.
Retesting:-Executing same test case with multiple sets of data(Test with postive and negative Scenerios).
Regression testing :-Executing or re-validating defect in newer bulids and beacuse of those fixes make sure there is no side effects for other componeents(impact analysis,impact testing).


Fuctional testing:-
------------------
1)error handling.
2)links.
3)data base testing.
4)object prperties.
